            <p> <strong>hello, i'm alex</strong><br><br>
                i started learning html and css roughly twenty days ago? and the website looks quite sorry for it.
                it is not that these 'languages' are hard to learn - its that i am thoroughly lacking motivation.
                looks like this will be my journal entry for 06/02/2023. i actually made substantial progress in
                terms of formatting and design. i also began looking into incorporating javascript... i will get 
                a slideshow in here by any means possible. today has passed surprisingly fast. i finally watched
                the little mermaid and while it was not as good as i hoped, i thoroughly enjoyed it. i will continue
                singing the sound track - not the ones with awkwafina tho. real ones know why. what a short entry.
                i always rush journaling when i do it too late and want to sleep instead.
